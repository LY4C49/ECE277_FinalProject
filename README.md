# ECE277_FinalProject

This is Final Project belonging to LY Li and HY Li.

We realize some DIP algorithms using GPU to accelearte. We also provide Python interface for people to use easily.

- Sharpening algorithm
- DCT and IDCT (using DCT to compress an image)

To compile our project, you should run
'''
pip install -e .
'''

Hardware Support:
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8300H CPU @ 2.30GHz   2.30 GHz
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti

Software Support:
- CUDA
- Visual Studio 2019

We also provide the algorithms implemented using CPU. Comparing with the GPU version, it is much slower!
